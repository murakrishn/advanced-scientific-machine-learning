    "# Typing systems\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a dynamically typed language.\n",
    "This means that the types of the objects used in a Python program is found at run-time.\n",
    "While this speeds up software development iterations, which makes programming error prone.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address this issue, Python has a number of optional static typing systems.\n",
    "These systems allow the programmer to specify the types of variables and function arguments.\n",
    "The Python interpreter can then check that the program is consistent with the types specified by the programmer.\n",
    "This allows the interpreter to catch a number of programming errors at compile time.\n",
    "Type hints in Python look like this:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def add(x: int, y: int) -> int:\n",
    "    return x + y\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions in `jax` are explained in the documentation using Haskell-like type signatures.\n",
    "These type signatures look like this:\n",
    "```haskell\n",
    "add :: a -> b -> c\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding about types and being familiar with Haskell-like type signatures will make it easier to understand the documentation for `jax`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Haskell's Type System\n",
    "\n",
    "Haskell has a strong static type system. This means that all functions are pure and all types are known at compile time.\n",
    "`jax` authors use Hakell type notation in their documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Primitive Types\n",
    "The primitive types in Haskell are:\n",
    "- `Int`\n",
    "- `Bool`\n",
    "- `Char`\n",
    "- `Double`\n",
    "- `Float`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Composite Types\n",
    "\n",
    "Lists are a _generic_ or _parametric_ type in Haskell.\n",
    "There type is written as `[T]`, where `T` is the type of the elements in the list.\n",
    "List of lists are written as `[[T]]`, and list of lists of lists are written as `[[[T]]]`, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Function Types\n",
    "The type of functions is written as `T -> U`, where `T` and `U` are type variables which can be replaced by any type.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a function that takes an `Int` and returns a `Bool` has type `Int -> Bool`.\n",
    "```haskell\n",
    "f :: Int -> Bool\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A function that takes a list of floats and returns a float can be typed as\n",
    "```haskell\n",
    "g :: [Float] -> Float\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A function that takes a list of type `T` and return a result of the same type `T` can be typed as\n",
    "```haskell\n",
    "h :: [T] -> T\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is called a _polymorphic_ function. It is a function that can be applied to arguments of any type."
